# Power-BI-Projects
Power BI dashboard analyzing citywide payroll data, including employee count, base salary, overtime payments, and agency-level insights
# Project Overview 
This repository contains a high-level breakdown of the city's payroll data, covering everything from borough-specific spending to individual top earners. It looks like the "Manhattan branch" is definitely the production environment here.
# Key System Metrics 
The city's workforce is massive, with over 541,000 employees currently on the payroll. Here is the high-level breakdown:
 Regular Gross Paid	- $88.14 Billion
 Total OT Paid - $7 Billion
 Max Regular Hours	- 4.17K
 Average OT Hours	- 59.13
 # Work Location Breakdown (Base Salary)
 Manhattan is clearly the primary "data center" for the city's operations, accounting for nearly 66% of the total base salary across all listed boroughs:
 Manhattan: $43 Billion 
 Queens: $9 Billion
 Brooklyn: $8 Billion
 Other: $5 Billion
 # Top Contributors (Individual Base Salaries)
 A few "power users" are leading the payroll charts. While most names are truncated or redacted, the top earners are bringing in significant figures:
 XXXX XXXX: $12.3 Million
 RODRIGUEZ: $11.3 Million
 XXX XXX: $8.7 Million
 RODRIGUEZ: $8.6 Million
 SMITH MICH: $8.2 Million
 # Observation 
 High OT Dependency: The $7 Billion OT spend suggests specific departments (like Police and Fire) are running near max capacity.
 Salary Concentration: Manhattan accounts for nearly 66% of the primary base salary budget.
